# AI Call Secretary Security Documentation

This document outlines the security features implemented in the AI Call Secretary system to protect sensitive user data, ensure secure communications, and prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Architecture

The AI Call Secretary system implements a comprehensive security architecture that addresses:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
2. **Data Protection and Encryption**
3. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
4. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**
5. **Security Logging and Auditing**
6. **Secure Communications**

### Components

The security system is composed of the following primary components:

- **Security Configuration** (`security_config.py`): Central configuration for all security settings
- **Security Middleware** (`middleware/security.py`): FastAPI middleware for authentication, CSRF, etc.
- **Audit Logging** (`security/audit_log.py`): Security event logging and monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection** (`security/intrusion_detection.py`): Detection of attack patterns
- **Encryption** (`security/encryption.py`): Encryption utilities for sensitive data
- **Data Access Control** (`security/data_access.py`): Access control for secure data access
- **Security Utilities** (`security/utils.py`): Helper functions for security features

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with the following features:

- Secure token generation and validation
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Password strength enforcement
- Brute force protection with account lockouts
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management

### Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) with the following roles:

- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Manager**: Access to calls, messages, appointments, and view-only access to settings
- **Operator**: Access to calls, messages, and appointments
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to calls, messages, and appointments

Resource-based permissions:

- **Read**: View data
- **Write**: Create or update data
- **Delete**: Remove data

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses Fernet for encrypting sensitive data at rest
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses RSA for secure key exchange
- **Password Hashing**: Uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for secure password storage
- **Field-level Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive fields in data objects

### Data Access Control

- **Field Sensitivity Levels**:
  - **Public**: Visible to all authenticated users
  - **Protected**: Visible to operators and above, masked for viewers
  - **Restricted**: Visible to admins only

- **Data Masking**: Automatically masks sensitive data based on user role
- **Access Logging**: All data access is logged for auditing

## Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Request Validation**: All incoming requests are validated against JSON schemas
- **Content-Type Checking**: Enforces allowed content types
- **Size Limits**: Enforces maximum content length
- **Input Sanitization**: Removes potentially dangerous content from user input
- **File Upload Validation**: Enforces file type and size limits

## Intrusion Detection and Prevention

- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects common attack patterns (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through rate limits on API endpoints
- **Brute Force Detection**: Detects and blocks brute force login attempts
- **IP Blacklisting**: Automatically blacklists suspicious IP addresses
- **User Blacklisting**: Blocks users exhibiting suspicious behavior

### Security Patterns Detected

- SQL Injection Attempts
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Path Traversal
- Distributed Attacks
- Credential Stuffing
- Unusual Access Patterns

## Security Logging and Auditing

- **Security Event Logging**: All security-related events are logged
- **Access Logging**: All data access is logged
- **Audit Trail**: Complete trail of system changes and accesses
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic rotation of logs after retention period
- **Suspicious Activity Alerts**: Alerts for suspicious activities

### Event Types Logged

- Authentication events (login, logout, etc.)
- Authorization events (access granted/denied)
- Data access events (read, write, delete)
- System events (startup, shutdown, config changes)
- Security events (rate limit exceeded, suspicious activity)

## Secure Communications

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communication is encrypted with HTTPS
- **Secure Headers**:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy

- **CSRF Protection**: Prevents cross-site request forgery
- **CORS Protection**: Controls cross-origin resource sharing

## Development vs. Production

The security system supports different modes:

- **Development Mode**: Relaxes certain security restrictions for development
- **Production Mode**: Enforces all security measures

To run in development mode:

```bash
python -m src.main --dev-mode
```

## Security Configuration

Security settings can be configured in the following ways:

1. **Configuration File**: `config/default.yml` and `config/production.yml`
2. **Environment Variables**: Override settings via environment variables
3. **Command Line**: Pass `--dev-mode` to enable development mode

Example environment variables:

```
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
DEVELOPMENT_MODE=false
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
```

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Never disable security features** in production
2. **Always validate user input** before processing
3. **Use the data access control system** for accessing data
4. **Log security events** using the audit log
5. **Follow the principle of least privilege** when assigning roles
6. **Encrypt sensitive data** using the encryption service
7. **Set strong passwords** and follow password policy
8. **Review security logs** regularly
9. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities
10. **Test security features** with security testing tools

## Security Testing

The system should be tested regularly for security vulnerabilities:

1. **Automated Security Testing**: Run automated security scanners
2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration tests
3. **Code Reviews**: Perform security-focused code reviews
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
5. **Security Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activities

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and determine extent of breach
3. **Remediation**: Fix vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Review and improve security measures

## Security Roadmap

Future security enhancements:

1. **Security Vulnerability Scanner**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
2. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integration with threat intelligence feeds
3. **Honeypots**: Traps for detecting unauthorized access
4. **Security Dashboard**: Real-time security monitoring dashboard
5. **Behavioral Analysis**: Advanced user behavior analytics
