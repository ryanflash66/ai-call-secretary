# Notification Sounds

This directory contains notification sounds for the AI Call Secretary web interface.

The following sound files should be placed here:
- `notification.mp3` - General notification sound
- `call.mp3` - New call notification sound
- `message.mp3` - New message notification sound
- `appointment.mp3` - New appointment notification sound

These sound files will be automatically loaded and played when corresponding events occur in the application.

Note: These are placeholder files. You'll need to add actual sound files to make notification sounds work.
